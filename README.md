# USSD External channel 
USSD External channel for RapidPro

This channel will laverage the existing RapidPro Generic External Channel API to communicate messages
between RapidPro and Mobile Network Operators through configurable USSD aggregator APIs.

The service is meant to treat the normal SMS flows in RapidPro to be compatible with USSD.
